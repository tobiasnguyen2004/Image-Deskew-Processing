# Image-Deskew-Processing

- Calculated statistics, like mean, median, and standard deviation of the errors of the dataset.
- Cleaned and sorted large datasets of images, each with a different skewed angle error, and processed them through a deskew program. After the program had been run, sorted the images based on different ranges of error still remaining after the deskew process, compared to the original image.
- Created a bounding box algorithm to identify the tables and charts within a document image. Afterward, extract the information/data from the table into a spreadsheet.
